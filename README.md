# php-snippet
For some reason...my PHP user snippets only work in vscode when I've put them in the HTML snippets....I also haven't found an extension yet that gives us an open-close tag...this isn't worth building an entire VScode extension for...but please feel free to add to your own project.

To install, place the snippet (copy/paste or download the file if you like) into your HTML.json user snippet file. Once you've done that, just type "pp" to use.
